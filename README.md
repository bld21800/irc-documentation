# IRC Documentation

## Details
This project was interesting. It took me some time to find good instructions on setting up an irc server. In a lot of the websites I went to the instructions were outdated and files would not work when I tried to download them. This began to make me frustrated then I decided to be patient. I eventually found a good website  to follow. The website I chose to follow was https://lowendbox.com/blog/how-to-setup-your-own-irc-server-using-inspircd-on-ubuntu/ . This website helped me out because I did not have any problems as I followed the steps. My only problem was when I got to the end at the step called Test it out by connecting with a IRC app. It asked me to download Mirc but I was unable to. I then tried to use pidgeon but I could not figure out what to put in each blank. This problem left me stuck and I got all the way to the end but could not finish. This caused me to get dissapointed so I decided to stop and not start over.

### Struggles
* Following the instrunctions
* Finding new instruction websites
* Putting in the details to the irc server towards the end

### Learned
* Patience is key
* Looking for other options can be a good thing
* Instructions can sometimes  be hard to follow

### Outcome
In this project I was not able to complete it. I got stuck towards the end when making my irc server. This was because the instructions I followed required me to have setup the server on windows and not ubuntu. I was unable to install Mirc to test the server so I had to stop there.
